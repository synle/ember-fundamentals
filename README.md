# Course outline and slides
 * [View course outline here](https://mike.works/course/ember-basics-cf22ed3)
 * [View slides here](https://docs.mike.works/ember-fundamentals-slides)

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)


# Getting Set Up

There are a few things you need to ensure you have installed, in order to be ready for this course.

### Node.js

You’ll need a relatively recent version (v4.5 or newer, v7 ideally) of node.js installed. On OS X, a great way of doing this without disturbing your existing dev environment is to install NVM. [Installation instructions are here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).

You’ll know everything is set up properly when you can run

```
nvm --version # might look like "0.31.4"
node --version # might look like "v7.7.3"
```

### Visual Studio Code

Particularly if you’ve never tried it before, you should install [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Some fantastic extensions that I use regularly include
* [ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [TSlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)
* [Ember-CLI in Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixrieseberg.vsc-ember-cli)
* [Ember Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emberjs.vscode-ember)

### Clone the Project
```sh
git clone git@github.com:mike-works/ember-fundamentals.git
```

### Install dependencies
```sh
cd ember-fundamentals
npm install
```

### Start the development server
```sh
